**Goal**: Increase the revenue of the App Store based on the existing app purchasing process.

Specifically, the project covered the following 4 areas:
**Exploratory analysis**: generating product improvement ideas from chaotic data
**Experiment design**: design framework for doing A/B test with statistical rigor
**Implementation**: build Python dashboard to show the output of the A/B test.
**Recommendation**: Make recommendations and advise next steps

Project Tasks Breakdown

1. Exploratory analysis
- EDA on the historical data
- Make one or a few recommendations to increase store revenue. Provide rationale

2. Experiment design:
- Describe the experiment design
- Measure the impact of the experiment

3. Implementation:
- Compute statistical significance between experiment and control
- Produce visualization showing the statistical significance

4. Recommendation:
- Interpret the result
- Make recommendation for next steps based on the experiment result

**Result**: Achieved a 10.70% revenue increase by analyzing the correlation between the user conversion rate and different payment methods in Python, promoting the credit card payment method through designing an experiment with case/control group, and A/B testing in the purchase flow
